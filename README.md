# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Retail

I have created a model which does exploratory data analysis on a retailer dataset . Dataset can be found at "https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl".

Steps to train a model:

- Firstly, import the libraries which we will be needed in this task i.e pandas, numpy, matlplot and sklearn
- Import the dataset in the module.
- Check the dimensions and also check whehter any null value present or not.
- Calculate the average profit
- Group top 10 states according to sales and profit and display them on bar graph.
- Using seaborn, plot different different visualization with category and sub-category to analyze the data.
